## NoteHarmony
Note Harmony is the second app of the Harmony-Family. It's a simple Android app for taking notes.

### Features
- Hide notes: There are some information, that not every user of your phone needs to see. Simply hide them with your biometrics, your lock screen pin or your own password (In progress)
- Collections: Structure your notes by putting them into a collection
- Automatically add URLs: When enabled, the app listens for URLs to be copied. (In progress [Takes more time as restrictions on Android requires me to change the way it works.])

### User privacy
Note Harmony does not collect your data. The recognition of copied data in your clipboard is fully automatic. Note, that Note Harmony will only check for changes in your clipboard **after** the start of the service.
